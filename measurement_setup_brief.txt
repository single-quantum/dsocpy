This is a small guide on how we perform the measurements, which serves as a check list to make sure we did everything correctly.

1. Connect DAC and AWG to your computer
2. Setup DAC through DAC38RF8xEVM software. Use Antonio's config file, located in the folder `config_files`, named ``
3. TURN ON THE WAVEFORM GENERATOR and connect to LMK CLKIN port (external DAC clock). The frequency should be 80.02833 MHz. 
4. Connect amplifier to output of AWG (15dB should be enough)
5. Turn on amplifier(s) (Two if the signal combiner box is used)

This is a small guide on how we perform the measurements, which serves as a check list to make sure we did everything correctly.

1. Connect DAC and AWG
2. Setup DAC, use Antonio's config file
3. TURN ON THE WAVEFORM GENERATOR (external DAC clock)
4. Connect amplifier to output of AWG
5. Turn on both amplifiers (also the one to the signal combiner box)
